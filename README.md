# Homesite Dataset: Stacking Model Approach

## Building the Ultimate Stacking Model

Welcome to the guide that takes your machine learning skills to the next level! 🚀 In this tutorial, we’ll explore how to create a stacking model by combining the best of Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, and MLP. Each model will go through rigorous Hyperparameter Tuning to optimize performance before we stack them together into the ultimate computational powerhouse. Think of it as assembling the Avengers of machine learning! 🦸‍♂️🤖

But before we dive into the stacking magic, pre-work is critical. Like any great recipe, the secret lies in preparation! We’ll start by shuffling the dataset to eliminate bias and applying SMOTE to handle any pesky class imbalances, ensuring our data is clean, balanced, and ready for action.

Check out the linked video for a deeper dive, and let’s connect to share insights and experiments. Together, we can push the boundaries of what machine learning can achieve! 💡✨
